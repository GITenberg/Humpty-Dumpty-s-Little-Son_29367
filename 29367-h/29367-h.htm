<div class="poem">
"Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,<br />
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.<br />
All the King's horses, and all the King's men,<br />
Couldn't put Humpty Dumpty together again."<br />
</div></div>

<p style="margin-top: 2.5em;">After Humpty Dumpty fell
off the wall and all the King's
horses and all the King's
men could not put him
together again, Little
Dumpty lived with his
Mother, who was called
Widow Dumpty, and went
to school every day. He
set off in good time every
morning&mdash;even if it was
<i>pouring</i> with rain. He had
a great many friends at
school, and the boys liked
him because he always had
plenty of marbles, and used
to carry sticky labels in his
pocket; he got them out of
his Mother's shop, and gave
them as prizes for racing
and jumping in play time.</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image border2" style="width: 370px; height: 570px;">
<img src="images/i007.jpg" width="370" height="570" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>


<div class="image border2" style="width: 373px; height: 570px;">
<img src="images/i010.jpg" width="373" height="570" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p class="pad">Little Dumpty was a little
bit like a <i>nice</i> goblin, it was
therefore very interesting to
his school fellows to have
him for a chum, and the
funny part about him was
that he never took his hat
off. Of course no one said
anything about it, but they
just remembered that his
Father was an egg, and got
cracked and broken, and
they thought that had something
to do with it.</p>

<p>Well, I will tell you how
Little Dumpty used to spend
his time. In summer he
used to get up quite early,
because he had to feed his
pets before breakfast. He
had a lot of pets in the yard
at the back of the house.
He had guinea-pigs, of
course, then he had three
rabbits and a pair of dormice
and a canary; and he had
some pigeons. They were
rather a bother to him, because
they had a nasty habit
of flying down the parlour
chimney, where sometimes
they stuck for two or three
days, and at last flew out all
black and sooty into the room. Widow Dumpty
used to be rather angry and
spoke crossly when this
happened, and then Little
Dumpty used to get up and
go out and feed his rabbits,
which is what he generally
did when he wasn't very
happy. Well, then he had
a tame hen and some silkworms.
Once he had a baby
chicken, but it ate some blue
chalk, which Dumpty had
dropped on the ground, and
died. He did all he could
to keep it alive but it was
no good. He was very sorry
about it, because he had
often longed for a little
chicken of his own; besides
his Mother had told him
that when it grew up it
would be a swimming
chicken. It was a pity too
he dropped the chalk, because
it got trodden on and
spoilt, and it had been his
favourite chalk.</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image border2" style="width: 359px; height: 570px;">
<img src="images/i015.jpg" width="359" height="570" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>


<div class="image border2" style="width: 362px; height: 570px;">
<img src="images/i018.jpg" width="362" height="570" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p class="pad">Well, as I was saying,
first he had to feed his pets
and to water his garden
before the sun got too hot:
and by then it was time for
breakfast. He and his
Mother were always very
happy at breakfast (except
when there was a pigeon in
the chimney). Generally
they talked about the garden,
and when the seeds
were coming up Widow
Dumpty used to send Little
Dumpty running out to
chivvy off the sparrows and
starlings who wanted to eat
all the young sprouts. In
the spring they talked about
tadpoles, and wondered how
long it would be before they
lost their tails; and in the
summer time they wondered
when Little Dumpty would
get a bath; and in the
autumn they talked about
the circus which was coming;
and in the winter about their
"poetry" which they made
up, or about the bulbs in the
pots at the window, which
always looked like blooming
for Christmas, and never <i>did</i>
bloom till March. Oh, and
lots of other things!</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image border2" style="width: 374px; height: 570px;">
<img src="images/i023.jpg" width="374" height="570" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="image border2" style="width: 377px; height: 570px;">
<img src="images/i026.jpg" width="377" height="570" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p class="pad">Little Dumpty generally
had bread and milk for
breakfast and finished up
with honey&mdash;for Mrs. Dumpty
kept dear little bees in
her garden, so there was always
plenty of that:&mdash;but
on Sundays Dumpty had a
poached egg for breakfast,
for a treat. When he'd done
his breakfast Dumpty used
to have to look sharp and
open the shop for his Mother
and sweep the step, and by
then it was time for school,
so he got his books together
and trotted off.</p>

<p>He used always to meet
his "chum" on the way;
<i>his</i> name was Binkie, and
he lived with his father at
the Blacksmith's&mdash;his father
<i>was</i> the Blacksmith, and
there was no Mrs. Blacksmith
because she was dead,
but Binkie's aunt, who
was a very kind lady, used
to take care of Binkie;
<i>her</i> name was Miss Amelia
Bloater.</p>

<p>Well, every morning Binkie
and Dumpty trudged
off to school together.
Dumpty's favourite lesson
was writing, he simply <i>loved</i>
doing copies, and once he
got a prize for writing; he
was quite delighted about
it, and often wished he could
get another, and after being
at school four years, at last he did&mdash;that was for
scripture.</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image border2" style="width: 373px; height: 570px;">
<img src="images/i031.jpg" width="373" height="570" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>


<div class="image border2" style="width: 374px; height: 570px;">
<img src="images/i034.jpg" width="374" height="570" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p class="pad">Dumpty used to stay at
school all day and had dinner
with the big boys; in the
afternoon there was "prep,"
and at four o'clock school
was over and all the boys
were jolly glad.</p>

<p>On his way home from
school Dumpty used to stop
and get cow-parsley for his
rabbits, and when silkworms
were "in" he used to have
to go into Binkie's garden
to get mulberry leaves, because
Binkie's father had a
mulberry tree in his garden
and Dumpty's Mother
hadn't. One day when
Dumpty got in from school
he found that a horrid great
rat had got into the empty
hutch where he kept all his
grain for feeding his pets
and had eaten it all and bitten
one of the baby pigeons!
He was so sad about it&mdash;but
Binkie's father soon
brought in his dogs and
they caught the nasty rat.
Dumpty's Mother often
said she didn't know what
she would do without her
kind neighbour the Blacksmith.</p>

<p>Well, by the time Master
Dumpty got in from school
it was pretty well tea time,
and in the summer he and
his Mother often had it in
the garden, not <i>too</i> far from
the house, so that if anyone
came into the shop they
could hear, that is to say
they <i>might</i> hear if he banged
on the counter loud, or shut
the shop door with a slam;&mdash;then
Dumpty would run
fast and serve in the shop
for his Mother. Sometimes
the customers were such a long time choosing a peppermint
stick or a few glass
beads that Dumpty thought
he should never get back to
his tea;&mdash;and they had
radishes and lettuce out of
their own garden. And
directly after tea Little
Dumpty did <i>just</i> what he
liked till bed-time.</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<img src="images/i042.jpg" width="373" height="570" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p class="pad">I must tell you now about
the things Little Dumpty
<i>did</i> like: there were lots of
things, and he liked them
all in turn.</p>

<p>One thing he loved was
ponding, which began as
soon as the days were warm
enough. He used to go
with a net and a little tin
pail and catch all kinds of
fish and little insects out of
the pond and put them in
his aquarium, but he called
it his "acquair." His "acquair"
was a glass bell
stood on its end and filled
at the bottom with sand, and
on top with water for the
things to swim about in.
Minnows, and sometimes
sticklebats (but not <i>generally</i>
sticklebats, because, though
they looked nice they used
to eat up the other things
so), and of course tadpoles
(when they were "in") and
water-snails with pointed
shells and caddis-worms
and water boatmen, and
"little reddies"&mdash;oh! and
anything he caught in his
net. Little Dumpty used to
bring them all home in his
pail and keep them in the
"acquair."</p>

<p>That's what Little Dumpty
and his Mother used to talk
about at breakfast, "how
long before the tadpoles lost
their tails."</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image border2" style="width: 378px; height: 570px;">
<img src="images/i047.jpg" width="378" height="570" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="image border2" style="width: 371px; height: 570px;">
<img src="images/i050.jpg" width="371" height="570" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p class="pad">Once when Mrs. Dumpty went away to see a sick
friend and Dumpty was left
all to himself he thought he
would have a lovely acquair
in the middle of his own
garden, just like a real pond,
so he dug a big hole and
planted ferns round it, and
then he got a big bath and
put it in the hole he had
dug, and filled it with water;
and it looked grand, and
Dumpty thought some rocks
in the middle of the pond
would look grander still, so
he got some clinkers and
with great trouble managed
to push them right out to
the middle, he was just
putting in the last one when
he toppled and fell splash-bash
right into the water. He
was in an awful mess when
he got out! And his
Mother, who came home
just at that minute, was very
angry with him. Poor
Little Dumpty was very sad
and ashamed of himself.</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image border2" style="width: 376px; height: 570px;">
<img src="images/i055.jpg" width="376" height="570" alt="" title="" />

<div class="image border2" style="width: 372px; height: 570px;">
<img src="images/i058.jpg" width="372" height="570" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p class="pad">The CIRCUS always
came to Eggy in the autumn,
and as Little Dumpty's
birthday was on October
31st his Mother always let
him go to it for a birthday
treat. He and Binkie used
to go together. It was
lovely fun first of all to go
round by the tents and see
the men getting ready for
the Show. Little Dumpty
felt that he knew quite a lot
of what went on behind the
scenes, for one day a man
who was putting up the
tents let him hold his hammer
for him. Dumpty saw
him afterwards playing in
the band and gave him a
little nod, but the man was
too busy to see him. It
disappointed Dumpty rather. The Circus was always a
treat, but the best part was
when the clown with the
performing pony said,
"Now Topsy"&mdash;that was
the pony's name&mdash;"you just
show me who you think
would make the finest
soldier in all this audience,"
and the pony ran straight
across the ring and nodded
its head at Dumpty! It
pleased him, because Dumpty
always said he was going
to be a soldier when he grew
up, and he often played at
being one. That pony knew
lots of things, it could say
what the time was, and
could tell how many of the
Kings of England had been
named Edward, but when
the clown asked the pony
"who was the butcher's
sweetheart?" Topsy made a
great mistake and all the
people laughed, for he went
and nodded at Binkie's
grown-up sister, and she
had <i>always</i> promised to
marry Dumpty when he was
big enough.</p>

<p>But I think Little Dumpty
liked the winter evenings
best of all, when he and his
Mother were so cosy in the
little kitchen at the back of
the shop. They used to
have great games together.
Dumpty had his own circus,
and gave grand performances
to his Mother. She used to
sit in the "Royal Box"
(which was the corner with
a shawl round it, and a
cushion for her feet). She
dressed him a little doll, who
was master of the ring, and
he had lots of animals in his
procession. Two elephants
and a bear on hind legs, and
a bear on four legs, a zebra, a tiger, a big squirrel, some
tin horses, and some lovely
horses covered with real
hair, a set of performing
frogs, and oh! heaps more.</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image border2" style="width: 376px; height: 570px;">
<img src="images/i063.jpg" width="376" height="570" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="image border2" style="width: 376px; height: 570px;">
<img src="images/i066.jpg" width="376" height="570" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p class="pad">Then for the performance
he would sing, and recite
the pieces of poetry which
he and his Mother had made
up (that's what I told you
they talked about at breakfast).
For instance, there
were two geese in a pen
which you wound up, and
Dumpty would put on a
quackie voice and say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
Some mischief sure will Satan find<br />
<span class="i2">For idle hands&mdash;however sweet,</span><br />
So in your idle moments wind<br />
<span class="i2">My little geese, and watch them eat.</span><br />
<br />
And as you wind, this lesson good<br />
<span class="i2">Ma' rag-time geese would teach to thee;</span><br />
Never to grab or snatch your food,<br />
<span class="i2">However hungry you may be.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>Then he had some performing
mice in a cage, with
clockwork inside, and as he
wound them up he sang:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
Oh, three performing mice are we,<br />
And when you wind us up you see,<br />
We twirl and twiddle round the cage,<br />
And play at leap-frog on the stage.<br />
And when the master of the ring,<br />
Commands us, we can also sing<br />
That story sad&mdash;though true to life,<br />
Of Blind Mice, and the Farmer's wife.<br />
</div></div>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image border2" style="width: 366px; height: 570px;">
<img src="images/i071.jpg" width="366" height="570" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="image border2" style="width: 372px; height: 570px;">
<img src="images/i074.jpg" width="372" height="570" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p class="pad">And then Little Dumpty
and his mother sang "Three
Blind Mice" together, very
slowly and sadly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
Three Blind Mice!<br />
<span class="i2">See how they run!</span><br />
They all ran after the Farmer's Wife,<br />
<span class="i2">Who cut off their tails with the carving knife,</span><br />
Did you ever see such a thing in your life<br />
<span class="i2">As three Blind Mice?</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>When he got all his horses
on the stage (he put the skin
ones in front because they
were the loveliest), he used
to pretend they danced while
he whistled a tune on the
penny whistle.</p>

<p>Then there was a china
girl with a parachute; when
she was on the stage Little
Dumpty recited the piece
called "Isabella's Parachute"
out of a favourite book he
had called "Cautionary
Stories":&mdash;</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
Once as little Isabella<br />
Ventured with a large umbrella,<br />
Out upon a rainy day<br />
She was nearly blown away.<br />
<br />
Sadly frightened then was she,<br />
For 'twas very near the sea,<br />
And the wind was very high,<br />
But, alas! no friend was nigh.<br />
<br />
Luckily her good mamma<br />
Saw her trouble from afar;<br />
Running just in time, she caught her<br />
Pretty little flying daughter.<br />
</div></div>

<p>And if he got an encore,
which he often did for this
piece, for he <i>loved</i> saying it,
he used to tell the story of
Robert:&mdash;</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image border2" style="width: 375px; height: 570px;">

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="block" style="margin-top: .5em;">
<div class="poem">
When the rain comes tumbling down<br />
In the country or the town,<br />
All good little girls and boys<br />
Stay at home and mind their toys.<br />
<br />
Robert thought,&mdash;"No, when it pours,<br />
It is better out of doors."<br />
Here you see him, silly fellow,<br />
Underneath his red umbrella.<br />
<br />
Now look at the silly fellow,<br />
The wind has caught his red umbrella,<br />
Up he flies to the skies;<br />
No one hears his screams and cries.<br />
<br />
No one ever yet could tell<br />
Where he stopped, or where he fell:<br />
Only, this one thing is plain,<br />
Bob was never seen again!<br />
</div></div>

<p>And they always used to
finish up with the black
nigger girl on horseback:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
Dis yah am de niggah gal<br />
<span class="i2">Come to say good night,</span><br />
Wishin' all de picanninies<br />
<span class="i2">Dreams of fairies bright.</span><br />
Wishin' all de niggah boys,<br />
<span class="i2">Plently laugh and fun,</span><br />
Wishin' dat this circus game<br />
<span class="i2">Was only jus' begun,</span><br />
'Stead of bein' as 'tis now,<br />
Finished, when I've made my bow.<br />
</div></div>

<p>Then Little Dumpty made
her jump up on the bareback
horse and bow to his
Mother.</p>

<p>At half-past seven Dumpty
had to "prepare," as he
said, that is he had to begin
to think about bed, just so
that bed-time shouldn't
come when he was in the
middle of something <i>very</i>
interesting, and at a quarter
to eight he had to go. He gave his Mother a kiss, and
often when he had been very
good and happy she gave
him an acid drop to suck
when he was in bed.</p>

<img src="images/i090.jpg" width="371" height="570" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p class="pad">Well, of course there were
lots more things Little
Dumpty used to do: I can't
tell them all because it
would take too long if I
were to tell you all about
his chalks and his paints
and his stone bricks and
his silver paper ball and his
kite&mdash;why it would fill ever
so many books, but I <i>must</i>
tell you one thing more and
that is about his card
houses. He was better at
that than at anything, and
one night his Mother offered
a prize of a cake of new
emerald green paint if he
could build eight houses.
And he <i>did</i>. He tried ever
so many times; and his
Mother had to let him sit
up a little later because just
as he had got to the sixth
storey safely, safely, after
striving very much, the
clock struck a quarter to
eight. It would have been
too bad to send him off then,
when he longed to do it so.
It quite made his fingers
tremble to put on the last
card. It was a good thing
he succeeded that once, for
he never did it again, and
he <i>did</i> want the green paint
so!</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
